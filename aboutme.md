**Artificial Intelligence Club of Sichuan University**, a.k.a **"SCUAI"**, is an academic club powered by **[Machine Intelligence Laboratory](http://zyimed.machineilab.org/) of Sichuan University**. The club was founded in 2018 and we invited **IEEE Fellow [Prof.Zhang Yi](http://www.machineilab.org/users/zhangyi/index.html)** as our advisor, who has in-depth research in the field of artificial intelligence.

SCUAI aims at "**Continuous learning, constant communication, and persistent innovation**". The main work of the club is divided into two parts. The first part is based on the artificial intelligence application, which promotes the learning and communication among members who have great interest in the field. Driven by the project, the interests and theories will be transformed into reality. The second part is to popularize related knowledge about artificial intelligence, helping students who are interested in learning but obstructed by requirement of professional knowledge into the field of artificial intelligence.

Welcome to join us and perform your talent in **Artificial Intelligence**!
